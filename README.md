## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned how to target elements based on their position as a child within their parent element.

### Continued development

In this challenge, my main difficulty was overlaying the FAQ text on top of the background image. I look forward to working with similar overlay issues and improving my approach to handling them.

### Useful resources

- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com) - This helped me find the desired fonts. It offers a wide range of font families that you can incorporate into your project by embedding their links or importing them.
